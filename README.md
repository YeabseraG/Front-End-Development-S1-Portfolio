Goal
In this portfolio you’re going to self-assess i.e you’re going to evaluate your own projects, showcase and include your projects during the Frontend Programme so far.
Create a single-page website showcasing 3 projects. For each project listed, mention in detail in the reflection report the things you would like to improve on after having done the project. By doing this, you acknowledge areas of improvement thereby motivating yourself to grow in experience and knowledge as a Frontend Developer.




Brief
The portfolio website must be built using HTML, CSS (no CSS frameworks can be used), and Vanilla JS only.

You must select 3 assignment submissions:

Cross Course Project (Rainydays)
Semester Project 1
Exam Project 1


These assignments must have been graded.

We are aware that Project Exam 1 might still be getting marked therefore do not make any changes to your submission other than the README.md.

Before submitting this portfolio assignment, you’re expected to make improvements to each project that you’re showcasing by using the detailed feedback provided by your teachers.

These improvements should also include your self-assessment which must be mentioned in the reflection PDF document.

Now that you have new skills up your sleeves, you can adapt the old assignments to display them. Think about how your previous assignments can be enhanced by applying your newly acquired skills.
